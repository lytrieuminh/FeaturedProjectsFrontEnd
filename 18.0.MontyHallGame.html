<!-- ✅ Let's practice our linking webpages skills by making a game show website where visitors win prizes if they choose the right option.
✅ We already have multiple files. Aside from the homepage, each webpage has an image, text, and a reset button for the prize behind each door.
✅ To make the game show website work, we'll add links to the other pages on the homepage.-->
