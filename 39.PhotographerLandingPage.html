Let's practice creating gradients by working on a landing page for a new app!
✅ We already have the HTML code, which consists of two headings and an image.
✅ We'll focus on styling the first heading and the body.-->

<!-- ✅ Photogram 2:
✅ Let's continue working on the landing page for Photogram. This time, we'll focus on styling the image beneath the heading.-->
