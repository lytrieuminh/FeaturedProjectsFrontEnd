<!-- ✅ Let's practice our knowledge of linking to local webpages by working on a popular social platform called Fret-it.
✅ The site already has four webpages with content in them: "index.html", "aliens.html", "e-tea.html", and "ufo.html" , but no links to them.
✅ We'add an unordered list of links inside "index.html" so that users can navigate to other pages from the homepage.-->
