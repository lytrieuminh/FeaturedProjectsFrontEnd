<!-- ✅ Stories for kids:
✅ A storyteller would like our help in using "flex-shrink" to create a responsive layout for their website.
✅ We'll use Flexbox to make the sections shrink automatically.-->

<!-- ✅ Stories for kids II:
✅ We'll now combine "flex-grow", "flex-shrink", and "flex-basis" properties to create the storytelling webpage that we created earlier.
✅ We already have some HTML code and styles.
✅ Our task will be to use Flexbox to make the main webpage section shrink and grow responsively.-->
